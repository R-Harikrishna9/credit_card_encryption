# Credit Card Encryption Project

This project provides a basic structure for securely encrypting and decrypting credit card data using AES encryption.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```

2. Run the encryption service:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Project Structure

- `encryption_service/`: Contains the encryption and decryption logic, as well as key management.
- `main.py`: The main entry point to run encryption and decryption operations.

## Note
For production use, replace the placeholder password in `config.py` with a secure password.
